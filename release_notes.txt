Package name: sans.models

2- Downloading and Installing

	2.1- System Requirements:
		- Python version >= 2.4 should be running on the system

	2.2- Installing:
		- Get the code from svn://danse.us/sans/releases/sansmodels-0.4.0
		- Execute the following: 
			python setup.py install

3- Known Issues

	3.1- All systems:
		- Q range validity of I(q) calculations.
			Our 1D models of I(q) use the function of the NCNR library 
			for their IGOR package (Klein, 2006). That library uses a
			fsat integration technique in some of its models (cylinders
			and ellipsoids). Integration is done using 76 points in the
			angle between the axis of the object and the q-vector, which
			translates in a larger inaccuracy at high q. Integratiing
			the 2D model I(q,phi) over all orientations of the object
			will not yield the exact same result as the NCNR calculation
			for q > 0.3 A-1.

	3.2- Windows:
		- None

	3.3- Linux:
		- None

4- Troubleshooting
